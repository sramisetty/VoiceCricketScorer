# Simple Cricket Scorer Deployment

## Current Status
- Production server is running at https://score.ramisetty.net
- Shows placeholder message: "Production deployment successful!"
- Infrastructure is working (Nginx, PM2, PostgreSQL, SSL)

## The Issue
The server has placeholder content instead of your actual Cricket Scorer application.

## Simple Solution

Since the infrastructure is working, you just need to replace the placeholder with your real application. Here's the simplest approach:

### Step 1: Use the existing deploy-full-app.sh script
This script creates a complete Cricket Scorer application structure on the server.

### Step 2: Run it directly on the production server
```bash
ssh root@67.227.251.94
cd /opt/cricket-scorer
./deploy-full-app.sh
```

This will replace the placeholder with a complete Cricket Scorer application featuring:
- Match management interface
- Voice scoring system
- Live scoreboard
- Team setup
- Real-time updates

The script creates everything from scratch on the server, so no file transfer is needed.

## Alternative: Use Replit Deploy
Deploy this project directly using Replit's built-in deployment feature, which will handle everything automatically.

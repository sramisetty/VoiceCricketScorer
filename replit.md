## Recent Changes (January 2025)
### January 25, 2025
- **✓ User Profile and Settings Implementation**: Created comprehensive User Profile and Settings components with personal information management, avatar display, and extensive settings controls including notifications, privacy, preferences, and security features. Added routing for /profile and /settings pages with backend API endpoints for profile updates, settings management, and password changes.
- **✓ Application Rebranding**: Updated application name from "CricketScore Pro" to "Score Pro" across the entire application including header navigation, login page, register page, and project documentation for consistent branding throughout the platform.
- **✓ Unified Logo Component**: Created shared Logo component for consistent branding across all pages with proper fallback handling, size variants (small/medium/large), and text display options. Implemented in header navigation, login page, and register page for visual consistency.
- **✓ Comprehensive Match Summary System**: Implemented complete match data API and comprehensive match summary component with full innings analysis, player statistics, match results, and detailed performance breakdown. Added CompleteMatchData type supporting multi-innings data retrieval, new `/api/matches/:id/complete` endpoint, and MatchSummary component with batting/bowling performance tabs, top performers display, and complete match history analysis.
- **✓ Match Details Page**: Created dedicated match details page (/match-details/:id) with comprehensive match summary, sharing functionality, and navigation integration. Added "Full Summary" button to completed matches on matches page alongside existing "Live View" button for enhanced match analysis capabilities.
- **✓ Enhanced Database Schema Support**: Updated storage interface and DatabaseStorage implementation with getCompleteMatchData method supporting complete match history retrieval including all innings, teams, players, balls, and statistics with proper database queries and data relationships.
- **✓ Automatic Scoreboard Redirect on Match Completion**: Implemented automatic redirection from scorer page to scoreboard when match status becomes 'completed'. Users receive a toast notification "Match Completed! Redirecting to scoreboard..." and are automatically taken to the scoreboard page after 2-3 seconds, eliminating the need for manual navigation after match completion.
- **✓ Critical ICC Validation Bug Fix**: Resolved cross-innings data contamination issue that was preventing ball recording in second innings. The validateOver function was incorrectly receiving balls from first innings (inningsId 15) when validating second innings (inningsId 16), causing "Maximum 6 valid balls per over" error on first ball. Root cause was improper Drizzle ORM query filtering using chained .where() calls instead of and() operator. Fixed by replacing `.where(eq(balls.inningsId, inningsId)).where(eq(balls.overNumber, ball.overNumber))` with `.where(and(eq(balls.inningsId, inningsId), eq(balls.overNumber, ball.overNumber)))` ensuring proper SQL AND condition application.
- **✓ Second Innings Scoring Restored**: Ball recording functionality now works correctly across innings transitions. Verified with successful test balls added to second innings with proper inningsId filtering and ICC rule validation working as designed.
- **✓ Over Number Display Synchronization Fix**: Resolved ball-by-ball commentary showing over count discrepancy issue. Root cause was multiple components using different over number calculation methods - commentary used database values while Current Over widget used `Math.floor(totalBalls / 6) + 1`. Fixed by standardizing all components (scorer.tsx, scoreboard.tsx, advanced-scorer.tsx, current-over.tsx) to use actual over number from database (`recentBalls[0].overNumber`) instead of mathematical calculations. Ensures consistent over numbering across all UI components.
- **✓ Mandatory Bowler Change After 6 Valid Balls**: Enhanced ICC Rule 17.1 enforcement to automatically detect when an over is complete (6 valid balls bowled) and force mandatory bowler change. Updated over completion detection logic in scorer.tsx to trigger dialog immediately after 6th valid ball. Added backend validation in ball creation endpoint to prevent any balls from being added when over is already complete. Ensures strict compliance with cricket rules requiring bowler change after each completed over.
- **✓ End Innings Functionality**: Implemented comprehensive "End Innings" feature allowing scorers to manually end the current innings through Quick Actions panel. First innings ending automatically creates second innings with proper team swapping, while second innings ending completes the match with final score display and status update.
- **✓ Comprehensive Player Statistics System**: Implemented complete cricket player statistics functionality with advanced database queries, aggregated career statistics, match history tracking, and detailed performance analytics including batting averages, strike rates, economy rates, boundary percentages, maiden overs, and comprehensive cricket metrics.
- **✓ Enhanced Database Analytics**: Created sophisticated SQL queries with joins and aggregations to calculate real-time player statistics from ball-by-ball data, including totalRuns, totalWickets, ballsFaced, ballsBowled, fours, sixes, maidenOvers, wideBalls, noBalls with proper ICC cricket rule compliance.
- **✓ Advanced Player Stats API**: Extended statsRoutes.ts with comprehensive player statistics endpoints including detailed player stats, performance comparisons, team statistics summaries, and enhanced filtering capabilities for franchise-based and role-based player analytics.
- **✓ Professional Statistics Dashboard**: Enhanced PlayerStats.tsx with comprehensive cricket statistics display including performance radar charts, match history visualization, advanced metrics cards, and detailed player comparison capabilities with proper color-coded statistics and professional cricket terminology.
- **✓ Real-Time Performance Tracking**: Implemented match history tracking with detailed performance charts showing runs, wickets, strike rates, and economy rates across recent matches, providing coaches and analysts with actionable insights for player development and team selection.
- **✓ Toss Dialog Implementation Fix**: Resolved critical issue where Start Match functionality was not opening toss dialog on matches page. Root cause was TypeScript errors and component rendering conflicts in original matches.tsx preventing dialog state updates from taking effect properly.
- **✓ Clean Matches Page Architecture**: Created matches-clean.tsx as replacement for problematic matches.tsx, eliminating TypeScript errors that were blocking dialog functionality. New implementation uses basic modal approach instead of shadcn Dialog component for reliable rendering.
- **✓ Comprehensive Toss Capture System**: Successfully implemented complete toss capture workflow including team selection dropdown, toss decision (bat/bowl first), form validation, loading states, and proper API integration with backend start match endpoint.
- **✓ Start Match Flow Completion**: Verified end-to-end match start functionality from toss dialog through to scorer page navigation, ensuring proper toss data capture and match state transitions work as designed.
